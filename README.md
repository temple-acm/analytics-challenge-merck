Temple University 2014 Analytics Challenge.

###The Challenge:
[Merck Challenge](http://ibit.temple.edu/analytics/impact-of-a-corporate-move/)
####Understanding A Corporate Moveâ€™s Impact
* What was the impact of relocating from Whitehouse Station, NJ to Kenilworth, NJ?
* How does this compare to the impact of relocating instead to West Point, PA?
* For either option, are certain organizations more negatively impacted than others?
* If the commute experience were the only factor in making a decision and Merck could move anywhere, is there a different location that would be ideal for most employees? For the surrounding communities?
